A way to generate prime numbers along with generating a [Ulam Spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral)

![Ulam Spiral](prime_plot.py)

Proceed as follows:

1. Generate the spiral once
   - Use the `spiral.py` to generate a spiral map.
   - You can only plot numbers <=length of spiral generated.
   - The map generated is a collection of coordinates depicting the square spiral
2. Generate the numbers to be highlighted
   - `prime_gen.py` is the default.
   - You can create any sequence of numbers.
3. Write a new script following the given rules.
   - Import paint_image from painter
   - Load the numbers to be plotted into a list/tuple
   - You can use make.py as a guideline
